There are three deliverables this week. Each are due on Sunday (January 10) by midnight.

### #1. Create a GitHub account, and start a new repo

*   Create a GitHub account, and create a project repo named “up206a-yourfirstname” - [Instructions](../../Git%20related/02%20-%20Create%20your%20class%20repo.md)
*   Create a Readme.md file in your GitHub class repo, and introduce your Data Science project space (hint: use this [markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))

### #2. Submit two or more datasets
Search for two or more potential data sources that you may use for your research. Make sure that they are "downloadable." Submit your dataset using the following google form:

### #3. Reading assignment
This week's reading assignment is for you to find an article, blog, journal, chapter, or book that talks about data/information/knowledge/coding that includes some spatial component. Make sure it is something that you would like to share with the class. Then, write a paragraph (yes, a paragraph, not two) that summarizes the article. Write a second paragraph where you reflect critically and creatively about the material in your own words. Why did this article speak to you in regards to your approach to data and research? How does it inform you own data science goals?

The instructors will select a few of the readings for discussion in week 2.

Submit your assignment by:

* Create a markdown file in your repo titled `Week1_reading_assignment.md` and submit your assignment using markdown code.
